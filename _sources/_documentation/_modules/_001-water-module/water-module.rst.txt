This is the first module of the :term:`SCHOOL` Curriculum. Here, you will
encounter several key datasets and use cases, each providing valuable lessons
in understanding the water cycle. Through guided exploration, you'll gain the
skills necessary to tackle water-related data, focusing on its significance
for society. The module is broken down into **three lessons**, each designed
to gradually increase in complexity, allowing you to build confidence in your
ability to handle and interpret data.

.. admonition:: Huge Thanks!
    :class: tip

    This course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA's
    :term:`TOPS` team, our :term:`SCHOOL` Open Science team, open science
    Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and the SCHOOL Development team!

Water Security Indicator Model (WSIM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this lesson, you'll work with historical data from the **Global Land Data
Assimilation System (GLDAS)** to explore **water anomalies**. We'll show you
how to access this data and guide you through creating advanced
visualizations. By working with both **R** and **Python** programming
languages, you'll gain a solid understanding of how historical water data can
reveal crucial patterns, like droughts or surpluses, which have broad
implications for ecosystems and societies.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Floods are a pressing issue that impacts millions globally. In this lesson,
you'll explore near real-time water anomaly data from **Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Near Real-Time (NRT)** Flood Data. You'll
learn how to access satellite data that captures these anomalies, process the
information, and use it for real-world applications, like disaster
preparedness and resource management.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lead in New York State Schools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the final lesson, you'll dive into the critical issue of **water
contamination**, with a focus on lead levels in New York State schools. This
lesson combines **US Census data** with water quality data to highlight the
importance of data cleaning, processing, and critical analysis. You'll also
learn to recognize and address the limitations in datasets |html-dash| a vital
skill for any researcher working with real-world data.

.. dropdown:: Goals & Outcomes

    This module isn't just about water; it's about giving you the tools to
    integrate :term:`Open Science` practices into your own work. By the end of
    the module, you'll have a solid foundation in data acquisition,
    processing, and visualization techniques. These skills will help you take
    what you've learned here and apply it to new datasets, transforming the
    way you approach your research.

    - Understand the significance of water data in scientific research.
    - Be able to access and analyze key water datasets from NASA.
    - Master techniques for data cleaning, analysis, and advanced
      visualizations.
    - Gain confidence in adapting these skills to other :term:`Open Science`
      workflows.
