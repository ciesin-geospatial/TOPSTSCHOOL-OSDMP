TOPST SCHOOL |badge-beta|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning**
(:term:`SCHOOL`), is an integral part of |website-tops| Training initiative.
Our mission is to cultivate a vibrant, inclusive culture of open science that
welcomes everyone |html-dash| students, researchers, and curious minds alike
|html-dash| to engage, learn, and contribute to the world of scientific
discovery.

The :term:`SCHOOL` curriculum is a thoughtfully designed program that offers
five immersive, 2.5-hour learning modules. These sessions are more than just
lessons |html-dash| they are interactive, interdisciplinary journeys through
some of the most critical themes of our time. Whether it's exploring the
intricacies of **water systems**, **health** and **air quality**,
**environmental justice**, **natural disasters**, **climate change**,
**agriculture**, or the challenges posed by **wildfires**, our curriculum
weaves together these diverse topics with a common thread, the importance of
`Open Science`_.

In each module, you'll find a rich blend of lessons that are not only
informative but also transformative. We dive deep into Earth Science
Applications, offering real-world use cases that show you how to access and
analyze vast data sources. These lessons are rooted in the principles of
:term:`FAIR` data management |html-dash| ensuring that the scientific data you
work with is **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and
**Reusable**. By learning to navigate these open data science lifecycle
workflows, you're not just gaining knowledge; you're acquiring the tools to
make meaningful contributions to the global scientific community.

.. tip::

    The :term:`SCHOOL` program covers a wide range of topics. Don't feel
    overwhelmed if you're new to some of them. Take your time with each
    module, and remember that learning is a continuous process. There are
    plenty of resources and a supportive community to help you along the way.
