"SCHOOL was conceived with the idea of bridging the gap between complex "
"scientific research and accessible, practical education. At its core, it "
"is about making the intricate processes of Data Science and Earth Science"
" not only understandable but also engaging and relevant to a broad "
"audience. The project's guiding principle is to ensure that everyone, "
"regardless of their background or prior experience, can participate in "
"and contribute to the world of :term:`Open Science`."
