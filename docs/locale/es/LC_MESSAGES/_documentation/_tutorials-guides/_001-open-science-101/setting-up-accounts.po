":term:`GitHub` is one of the most powerful tools in the world of "
"collaborative research, open science, and software development. It's more"
" than just a platform for storing code |html-dash| it's a vibrant "
"community where you can contribute to projects, share data, and "
"collaborate with fellow researchers from all over the world. Whether "
"you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, GitHub provides the tools you need"

"At its core, GitHub is a hosting service for version control using Git. "
"This means it helps you track changes in your work, collaborate with "
"others seamlessly, and manage multiple versions of a project. Many of "
"NASA's open science projects, including the :term:`TOPS` :term:`SCHOOL` "
"initiative, use GitHub to share their work and invite contributions from "
"the global community. So, setting up a GitHub account is the first step "
"toward being part of this exciting, inclusive movement."
