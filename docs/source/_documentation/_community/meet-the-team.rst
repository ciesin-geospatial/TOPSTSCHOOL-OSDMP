The :term:`SCHOOL` project is an ambitious and innovative initiative designed
to advance education in the field of data science, specifically within the
context of :term:`NASA`'s Earth Science Applied Sciences Program. This project
is not just another online learning platform; it represents a comprehensive
effort to democratize access to scientific knowledge and foster a new
generation of learners equipped to tackle some of the most pressing challenges
in Earth Science.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vision Behind
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCHOOL was conceived with the idea of bridging the gap between complex
scientific research and accessible, practical education. At its core, it is
about making the intricate processes of Data Science and Earth Science not
only understandable but also engaging and relevant to a broad audience. The
project's guiding principle is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their
background or prior experience, can participate in and contribute to the world
of :term:`Open Science`.
