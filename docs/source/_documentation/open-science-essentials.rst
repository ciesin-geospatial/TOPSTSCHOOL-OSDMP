Prelude
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`NASA` is at the forefront of a transformative movement in the scientific
community |html-dash| one that is rooted in the principles of openness,
collaboration, and inclusivity. Over the next decade, NASA is making a
long-term commitment to fostering an inclusive Open Science community, where
the sharing of software, data, and knowledge happens as early as possible in
the scientific process. This initiative, known as `Open Science`_ at NASA,
represents a cultural shift that goes beyond just technological advancements.

Open Source Science: A Commitment to Transparency
===============================================================================

Open-Source Science is NASA's pledge to make the entire scientific process
transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. This involves the open
sharing of all aspects of research, including software, data, algorithms,
papers, documents, and ancillary information, from the very beginning. By
doing so, NASA is not just advancing technology but is also pushing for a
cultural transformation in the way science is conducted.

The principles of open-source science are built on the idea that publicly
funded research should be accessible to everyone. This openness allows for
greater collaboration, reduces duplication of efforts, and broadens the user
community. It also ensures that scientific research is reproducible, thereby
increasing the reliability and impact of scientific findings.

    the spirit of Open Science. By sharing data transparently and including
    diverse scientists in the process, NASA's open-source science approach
    accelerates groundbreaking discoveries and fosters a more inclusive and
    collaborative scientific community. [#nasa_open_science_reference]_


Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Initiative
===============================================================================

To help the scientific community and the public adopt Open Science practices,
NASA has launched the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative [#]_. This
initiative aims to educate and empower researchers, academics, and the general
public by providing them with the tools and knowledge they need to implement
Open Science in their work. One of the key offerings of the TOPS initiative is
"`Open Science 101`_," a free online training course that provides a practical
understanding of Open Science principles.

The Benefits of Open Science
===============================================================================

Open Science, when properly implemented, offers a multitude of benefits that
can revolutionize the way research is conducted and utilized. Below are four
key areas where Open Science makes a significant impact:
