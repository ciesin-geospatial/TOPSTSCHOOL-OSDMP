GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`GitHub` is one of the most powerful tools in the world of collaborative
research, open science, and software development. It's more than just a
platform for storing code |html-dash| it's a vibrant community where you can
contribute to projects, share data, and collaborate with fellow researchers
from all over the world. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, GitHub
provides the tools you need to manage projects, contribute to
:term:`Open Science`, and share your findings.

At its core, GitHub is a hosting service for version control using Git. This
means it helps you track changes in your work, collaborate with others
seamlessly, and manage multiple versions of a project. Many of NASA's open
science projects, including the :term:`TOPS` :term:`SCHOOL` initiative, use
GitHub to share their work and invite contributions from the global community.
So, setting up a GitHub account is the first step toward being part of this
exciting, inclusive movement.

Let's walk through how to create your personal GitHub account and get started
with open science!

Creating GitHub Account
===============================================================================

.. hint::

    If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this guide and checkout
    things to do to secure your GitHub account below.

Creating a GitHub account is the gateway to becoming a part of a collaborative
world of scientific discovery and contribution. Follow these simple steps to
get started. Don't worry if you're new to GitHub |html-dash| this guide will
walk you through each step with empathy and clarity, so you feel supported
from start to finish.

#. Go to `GitHub`_.
#. In the upper-right corner of the page, click on the **Sign Up** button to
   start creating your personal account. GitHub will guide you through the
   process, one step at a time.
#. You will be asked for a **username**, **email address**, and to create a
   **password**.

.. important::

    Your **username** will be your unique identity on GitHub, and it's how 
    others will find and recognize you on the platform. Your **email address**
    is important because GitHub will use it to communicate with you. Make sure
    it's an email address you check regularly. Choose a **strong password** to
    protect your account. GitHub recommends using a combination of upper and
    lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols for added security.

4. Once you've entered your details, :term:`GitHub` will send a verification
   email to the address you provided.
#. Check your inbox (and your spam folder if you don't see it) and click the
   link to verify your email address.
#. Without verifying your email, you won't be able to perform certain tasks
   like creating repositories, so this step is important!
#. You'll be asked to complete a simple CAPTCHA (a quick task to confirm
   you're not a robot). Just follow the instructions, and you're good to go.
#. GitHub will prompt you to choose a plan. For most users just starting with
   :term:`Open Science`, the **Free** plan is more than enough. You can always
   upgrade later if you need advanced features like private repositories, but
   for now, you're all set with the free option!
#. Once your account is set up, you'll land on your GitHub dashboard. This is
   your home base for creating projects, exploring repositories, and
   contributing to open science. GitHub offers a helpful tutorial called
   **"Hello World"** to get you started with the basics |html-dash| like
   creating your first repository and understanding essential concepts like
   **branching**, **commits**, and **pull requests**.

.. tip::

    For added security, it's recommended that you set up **Two-Factor
    Authentication (2FA)**. This provides an extra layer of protection for your
    account. You can enable 2FA from your account settings by following this
    guide.

Now that your account is ready, you're all set to explore the world of
:term:`Open Science` and contribute to exciting projects. In the next section,
we'll dive deeper into using GitHub, setting up repositories, and learning how
to collaborate on :term:`NASA`'s open science initiatives.

            Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security
            to your GitHub account by requiring a second form of verification
            beyond just your password. Here's how to set it up:

            - Navigate to Security Settings by clicking on to your Profile
              :menuselection:`Settings --> Password and authentication`
            - Under the "Two-factor authentication" section, click the button
              to begin the setup process. Choose your authentication method.
              :term:`GitHub` offers several MFA options.

            - Follow the setup instructions and remaining prompts to complete
              the MFA setup. Ensure you test the MFA method to confirm it's
              working properly.

ORCID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you'll learn how to create your :term:`ORCID` account, an
important step to ensure that your research and contributions are easily
identifiable and accessible in the Open Science community. Don't worry if this
is your first time doing this |html-dash| the process is straightforward, and
this guide will help you through each step.

What is ORCID and Why You Need It?
===============================================================================

Before we dive into the steps, let's talk about why having an ORCID account is
important.

:term:`ORCID` provides a unique, persistent identifier for researchers,
ensuring that your contributions are correctly attributed to you, regardless
of any changes :term:`Open Science`, where collaboration and transparency are
key. Your ORCID profile becomes your digital fingerprint in the world of
research, linking your work to your name in a global, accessible database.

Creating ORCID Account
===============================================================================

#. Go to `ORCID`_.
#. You'll see a form asking for some basic information. No worries, this will
   only take a minute or two. Enter your information like your **first** and
   **last** name, **primary email address** (this is where all your
   notifications will be sent), possibly a **secondary email address** 
   (optional but recommended, to ensure you don't lose access in case you
   forget your credentials).
#. Next would be the password, make sure your password is something
   memorable but secure. Instructions about the password requirements would be
   mentioned while entering the password.

.. tip::

    Set your visibility preferences. :term:`ORCID` gives you control over the
    privacy of your information. You can set your profile to be:

    - **Public.** Anyone can see your information.
    - **Limited.** Only trusted parties (like your institution) can view your
      profile.
    - **Private.** Only you can see your information.

    It is best to keep it **Public** to maximize visibility for your work in
    :term:`Open Science`, but you can always change it later.

4. Before you complete the registration, you'll need to agree to ORCID's terms.
   These are pretty straightforward and ensure that your data is used
   responsibly.
#. Now that your account is created, ORCID will send a verification email to
   primary email address you provided. It's important to verify your email to
   complete the setup. Check your inbox (and your spam folder if you don't see
   it) and click the link to verify your email address.

And there you go! You've officially created your ORCID account!

.. dropdown:: Personalizing Your ORCID Profile

    This step is crucial in making sure your ORCID profile represents you well.
    The more information you provide, the easier it will be for collaborators
    and institutions to find you and recognize your work.

    ORCID supports integration with various platforms, including GitHub and
    LinkedIn. You can link your ORCID profile to your GitHub account to create
    a cohesive professional identity across platforms.

    sure to keep it updated with your latest contributions, projects, and
    affiliations. This is especially important in :term:`Open Science`, where
    collaboration and visibility are key.

    .. tip::

        Set a reminder to check and update your profile every few months. That
        way, your information stays fresh and accurate.

Make the Most of Your ORCID
===============================================================================

Now that you've created and set up your ORCID account, you're ready to start
using your :term:`ORCID` ID in your research. Include it in your **CV**,
**Research papers**, **Articles**, **Conference presentations** and **Grant
applications**. This unique identifier will ensure that all your work is
properly attributed to you, wherever it's shared.
