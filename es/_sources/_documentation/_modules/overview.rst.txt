We're thrilled to welcome you to the modules of :term:`NASA`'s :term:`SCHOOL`
program! This curriculum is part of NASA's :term:`TOPS` Training initiative,
an effort designed to empower learners with practical skills in the **data
science lifecycle** using real-world data from NASA's Earth Sciences division.
By participating in this program, you'll join a community of passionate
researchers and learners dedicated to advancing :term:`Open Science` through
collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity.

.. dropdown:: Exploring the Critical Role of Water in Society

    Water is one of the Earth's most essential resources, and understanding its
    behavior is key to predicting environmental changes and mitigating their
    impacts. It is the first SCHOOL module and we'll explore **Water** and its
    relationship with humans. How does the water cycle impact society? How are
    changes in water availability, quality, and patterns affecting communities
    worldwide? [#]_ This module aims to answer these vital questions.

    You'll delve into three carefully selected **use cases** that highlight
    critical water-related issues, such as usage, safety, and anomalies like
    droughts and floods. Each case presents a unique dataset that will guide
    you through the process of accessing, analyzing, and visualizing water
    data. We'll teach you how to clean and process this data, focus on areas
    of interest, and ultimately, create compelling visualizations that can be
    shared within your community. By the end of this module, you'll not only
    have a better understanding of water science but also be equipped to apply
    these skills to other **Open Science** challenges.

    Whether you're an **undergraduate student** or an **early-career
    researcher** with some exposure to coding, this module is designed to meet
    you where you are. You don't need to be an Earth scientist or a coding
    expert; all that's required is a willingness to learn. Throughout this
    journey, you'll become familiar with the **data science lifecycle**,
    learning how to acquire, process, and analyze data, particularly in the
    context of **Open Science**.

The skills you'll acquire are adaptable and scalable, allowing you to
integrate them into your own research or academic projects. This module won't
just teach you about water science |html-dash| it will help you become a more
effective data-driven researcher.

.. dropdown:: Prerequisites & Glossary

    Before starting the hands-on lessons, you'll need to familiarize yourself
    with certain **prerequisites** and **technical terms**. These will help
    you navigate the dataset and analytical processes more effectively. We've
    put together a glossary of key terms that will be used throughout the
    module, ensuring you're never left in the dark.

.. important::

    This program doesn't aim to deliver a comprehensive Earth science
    curriculum or make you a coding guru. Instead, it is here to provide you
    with a solid foundation that you can build upon and apply to your own
    :term:`Open Science` projects. If you want to further explore Open Science
    concepts, be sure to check out NASA's TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum.
